# ImFree

Easily share times that you're free with others. No more needing to constantly ask when people can hang out!

ImFree is built with React Native, TypeScript and Expo. It's backend is hosted on Firebase, using their Authentication, Firestore and Cloud Functions services. 
The only login option is to use Facebook, as this allows for easy sharing of times with friends

It will be on the iOS App Store and Google Play store eventually, but currently Facebook are not reviewing applications due to the current health crisis and so I am unable to publish it yet. Soon, though!
